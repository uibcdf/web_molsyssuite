# MolSysSuite Website (Product Landing)

    Product/landing website for **MolSysSuite**.

This site is **not** the technical documentation (Sphinx docs remain in each library repo). It is a product narrative hub hosted under `www.uibcdf.org/molsyssuite`.

    **Live site:** https://www.uibcdf.org/molsyssuite/

    ## What’s in this repo
    - `web/` — Astro site source
    - `devguide/` — project checkpoint (concept, IA, content model, decisions, deploy, workflow)
    - `resources/` — logos, images, diagrams used by the site

    ## MVP navigation
    - Ecosystem
- Workflows
- Get started
- Updates

    ## Content editing (Markdown-first)
    Content lives under `web/src/content/` (see `devguide/CONTENT_MODEL.md`).
    Updates (blog) and other content are edited via GitHub by modifying the Markdown files.

    ## Development (local)
    This repo is designed to be developed locally (often with Codex) after cloning.
    See `devguide/06_workflow_with_codex.md`.
