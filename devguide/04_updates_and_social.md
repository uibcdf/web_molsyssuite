# Updates & social diffusion policy — MolSysSuite Product Site

    This site is Markdown-first and static. Social platforms are treated as **distribution channels**.

    ## Canonical source of truth
    - Posts on this site (under `web/src/content/`) are canonical.
    - Social networks link back to the canonical post/page.

    ## Embeds
    - Embeds are optional and must never be required for core content.
    - Place embeds below the fold and provide explicit “Follow us” links.

    ## OpenGraph & sharing
    - Every post should have a strong title + 1–2 line summary (used for previews).
    - Provide a default OpenGraph image and allow post-specific OG images later.

    ## Practical rule
    Prefer a stable, curated “Latest updates” list over a fragile live timeline.

    ## Project-specific notes
    - Updates blog is the main diffusion engine (releases, workshops, design notes).
- Link out to per-library docs and repos.
