# Concept — MolSysSuite Product Site

## Purpose
Provide a clear product landing for MolSysSuite: what it is, why it exists, the ecosystem components, example workflows, how to start, and how to engage with the community. A lightweight blog reports development updates.

## Primary audience
Computational biologists, bioinformaticians, structural biologists, drug design researchers, and developers evaluating or adopting MolSysSuite.

## Success criteria (how we know it works)
Visitors understand the ecosystem quickly, can navigate to the right component and its Sphinx docs, and can follow progress via updates.

## Constraints
- Static site (no backend required for MVP).
- Content editable via GitHub (Decap CMS considered later).
- “Less is more”: clarity and hierarchy over ornament.
