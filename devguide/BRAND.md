# Brand & tone — MolSysSuite Product Site


This document defines the *minimum* design and writing rules so the site stays coherent as it grows.
The goal is consistent clarity, not design complexity.

## Core principle
**Less is more.** Prefer whitespace, restraint, and strong hierarchy over decorative UI.

## Visual system (minimum viable)
- Typography: 1–2 font families maximum.
- Layout: generous spacing; avoid dense pages.
- Components: reuse a small set (Hero, Section, Card, CTA, Footer).
- Colors: minimal palette, high contrast, accessible.

## Content system
- Titles: short and concrete.
- Paragraphs: avoid walls of text; use short sections.
- Lists: use only where they increase clarity.
- Links: prefer descriptive labels (“Explore MolSysMT docs”) instead of raw URLs.

## Accessibility (baseline)
- Adequate contrast.
- Logical heading order (H1 → H2 → H3).
- Images must include alt text.

## What we avoid
- Carousels unless they provide real value.
- Auto-playing media.
- Infinite timelines.
- Decorative animations that distract from content.


## Shared identity note
This site may share visual DNA with the UIBCDF lab site, but the voice is *product-first*: clear value proposition, ecosystem coherence, and confident restraint.


## Palette note
Allow a slightly more ‘product’ accent than the lab site, but keep the palette minimal.


## Voice note
Tone: precise, confident, collaborative. Avoid overpromising; show the foundation and invite evolution with users.
