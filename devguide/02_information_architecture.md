# Information architecture (IA) — MolSysSuite Product Site

This file freezes the MVP sitemap and navigation decisions.

## Top navigation (MVP)

- Ecosystem
- Workflows
- Get started
- Updates
- Community

## Notes
- This site is a **product landing**, not a documentation system.
- The “Get started” page is deliberately short; it links out to each library’s Sphinx docs.
- Home page shows latest 3–5 posts from the Updates blog.
- Keep component descriptions concrete: what problem it solves, key capability, link to docs/repo.
